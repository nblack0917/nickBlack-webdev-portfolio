I grew up in the suburbs of Northern New Jersey where I spent most of my youth exploring the woods and old, forgotten buildings. While I experimented with many subjects during school, I eventually focused on art and design. This led me to get my BFA degree in Illustration from the Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida. From there I found myself entrenched in the screen printing industry. By 2008 I was the owner of a boutique and art gallery, and I was running my own screen printing company. Eventually, I found my way to Austin, Texas, where I have been making the most of life. In 2020, I decided to transition into a new career with web development.

I recently graduated from Austin Coding Academy with a certificate in Full Stack Web Development. ACA not only taught me industry standard development skills, but they also helped me build the foundation for learning and advancing further. I am now proficient in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript ES6, React.js, Redux, Express.js, mySQL, Git, and several other frameworks, and libraries. I'm currently taking it upon myself to learn React Native, and I have plans to explore Python and Unity in the near future.
